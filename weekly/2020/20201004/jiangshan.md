Before this week, I hope I can enjoy a National day vacation, but it about drive me mad when I heard we have no right to get out of school without teacher's permission.

Although it's easy 2 get leave permite, I still chose stay at dormitory, play some video games and spend time with sleeping.

WTF???????? It's ,my turn 2 teach algorithm? I have 2 let all others know  how 2 use a suffix tree?

let M.I.T's professor do that, I just tell them basic knowledge.

Genshin impact is not such good as expact. Without artwork, it's just a work which can made by a college student.

I gave Cinder Drift(Extreme) a try, that duplicate is such difficalt that take the whole team over 3 hours to get through it. May be I have a glimpse about the pleasure of MMORPG.

I miss the air conditioning at home. It's really hot at noon and cold at night. I'll try my best not let cold catch me.
