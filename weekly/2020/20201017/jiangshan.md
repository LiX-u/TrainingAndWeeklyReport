###text

- It has been a long time I write last weeklyReport. XD Last week I took part in UEDCSP(Undergraduate Electrionics Design Contest of ShanDong Province), Our team choosed the problem A, finally, I think we did not got a good grade. As a result, I have learned less algorithm.

- I have watched videos made by professor Wu'enda which about Deep Learning. The cost function and lost function is very intresting (maybe?). I leared about the logistic regression and sigmoid function. Maybe I can use that in next CUMCM.

- Artificial intelligence is quiet fun that maybe I can spend more time on that. Before I can understande some defination, I think I should learn more about linear algebra and probability theory.

- I think I should learn more thing follow that book named ~Algorithm comptettion collection~. (book name translated by google.)

###epilog

I really need a rest after the UEDCSP(maybe it's not a formal name). I just sleep less than 4 hours a day. *(#%$^#$%@#%
