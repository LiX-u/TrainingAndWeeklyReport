### Prelog
During this week, a lot things have done.   

First of all, I have learned about how to write the first part of IELTS writing. 
Although it's review, but it still help a lot as I have almost forget everything I have learned last time.

To improve my English skill while having fun, I have installed Arknights (US version) and restart my jounery against Reunion Movement
with Rhodes Island. Trivaling with Cynthiaï¼Œ I tried to develop a new mod for Tetra Project, with the help of algorithm, I have understood
the 'List' and 'Foreach' function easily. However, I still dont understand why Alive not add such a variable based each save data.

I tried installed a pitch which aiming on append a Ray tracing step after the render pipeline of the original game render of Final Fantacy XIV online.
I think FFXIV is really a good game. lol. After reshader is installed, the graphic has a sharp inctease while my GPU is almost could fry chips.

### text.

Along three contests about take part in the ICPC contest, our team have reached 4th rank at each of them. Its dramatic and amazing. with my teammates,
I think our team may have a chance take part in that world-wide competition.

As Im playing a role of translater and supporter in my team, I still need improve my English skill. Not only I need that for passing IELTS test,
but also I want learn more language to broaden my horizon while knowledges of other culture is very interesting to explore.

### Epilog
I will do more practice about algorithm as I need more knowledge to understand deeplearning algorithm and other artificial inteligence algorithms.

In next week, I'll learn things about Android develop. After knowing the process of a program's whole life, connect with the knowledge of
Windows programing, I think I can have a better understanding of that.

Really thanks Boss Li and Boss Ji, they gave me a lot help. I believe it's not lot, it's our effort made that.
