### what done

- The CUMCM( China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling ). 

This is my first time take part in such a contest which is nationwide. During these three days, I have learned a lot about algorithm which is in the scope of machine learning and mathmatic. By the way, SPSS is really a fantastic software when u caught by data analysis issures.

Although our teacher suggested us use MATLAB to solve the problem, as a student of computer science, I still trust python. As a program language with a huge amount of libs, python can provide a lot method to solve these complicated math problems with less than 10 rows. ~~I love python a lot.~~


- python

As the CUMCM is the main function in this week, python is a function called by a sentence. While I'm solving these complicated math problems, I must use python to arm myself so I can finally kill these twisting and dread demons.

In the scope of python, class is still the keyword which tell your PC u r coding a class, but for methods, u must use self as a parameter like this:
`	def method(self):`

what's the most fantastic, u can insert attributes for different objects, thanks to this, u never know how many attributes a object have.

### Epilogue

in next week, I may learn sth about suffix tree. I believe I have understand most of it, I still need 2 do some exprement to make sure my ideas.
