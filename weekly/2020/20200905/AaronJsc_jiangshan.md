###### ~~Prelog~~
Actually this is the first time I write a Weekly Report. It's quiet fun  for me and maybe interesting. I think its just like a weekly diary,maybe.    

I decided 2 write this article in a fun (maybe) and not such acdemic way. :)

### Text

#### Of this week
+ KMP Algorithm.  

Early in this week, I reviewed the KMP algorithm. Although I have learned it a term before ( That's really a long period of time. ). I have forgot most of it. Even the next array I cannot initialize correctly. After that, I picked up what I lost.

+ Linear Algebra.  

In this term, I have a linear algebra class. Before our class begin, I got a M.I.T open course (it seems like named that.) and planned to give it a preview. I have learned martix, the idea of elimination and something more.

+ Trie, Suffix Trie and Suffix Tree.  

Although I got a glimpse of Suffix Tree before, I have never give it a try. Thanks to the knowledge of the Trie, I can code a Suffix Trie myself now.

+ Remember that the SIZE() of a vector container is unsigned!!!!!  

At the end of the week, I attended a contest as before (not yet) I got a segmentation fault. It happend within the scope of these code-
```for(int i = 0; i < deck.size() - 1; i++) cout << deck[i] << deck[i + 1] << endl;```
It seems correct, right? (wara)  
It gave me a big surprise, segmentation fault.
After ask Mr.Zhang and Mr.Guan, I have finally solved that problem. It is the size capacity of the vector container is a unsigned number. Thanks to unsigned, the subtraction makes it a GREAT number. What a funny and f**king thing! :|

+ SSM frame.  

I have learned some thing of the web programming, like ssm frame and other things. Although I can only use one database, I can creat many tables 2 save huge amount of data and switch table 2 select specific item.

#### Thoughts
+ It is my first time write weekly report and that makes me feels strange and amazing, just like I'm back 2 the time when I still keep my diary and write down my daily lives.


+ I still have many things 2 do and keep on going is the most important thing. There is  only practice can make one better.


+ ~~Im nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooob~~.

#### To do list
+ Suffix Tree!  

It seems interesting, maybe I can understand it oneday just like when I learn KMP.

+ Linear algebra  

SIMD command is the best innovation (Cry out loudly) :)
Martix saiko!!!!!!! (lol)

+ SSM frame  

Set up a website from a empty page is quiet interesting. I can follow my interest and maybe I can make a beautiful website oneday (Dreaming)

###### ~~Epilogue~~
I will never tell u I use Eng just cuz I dont want install a CHN input.(in a really small voice)   

Ahhh! u know it!

~~maybe next time I need learn something from H.P.Lovecraft?~~
